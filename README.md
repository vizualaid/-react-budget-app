#Problem Statement:
Many people struggle with keeping track of their expenses and budgeting for specific expenses. Without a clear understanding of where their money is going, they often overspend and find themselves in financial stress.

#Solution: 
Our project is a budget tracking tool that allows users to add budget amounts for particular expenses and track their overall spending. The tool will have features to add subscriptions and their amounts, and the ability to delete expenses when they are no longer relevant.
